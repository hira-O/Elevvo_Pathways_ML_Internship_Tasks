# Task 1: Student Score Prediction

## Introduction
Build a model to predict students' exam scores based on study hours. The task also explores the effect of different features on student performance.


## Dataset
- **Source:** [Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Contains information on study hours, participation, and other factors affecting exam scores.
  
## Task Completion Points
- Load and clean the dataset.  
- Perform basic visualizations to understand relationships.  
- Split into training and testing sets.  
- Train a **Linear Regression model** to predict scores.  
- Visualize predictions vs actual values.  
- Evaluate with metrics like **MSE, RÂ²**.  
- **Bonus:** Try **Polynomial Regression** and experiment with adding/removing features.
