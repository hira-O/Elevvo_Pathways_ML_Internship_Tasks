# Task 8: Traffic Sign Recognition

## Introduction
Classify traffic signs from images using deep learning models.

## Task Completion Points
- Preprocess images (resize, normalize).  
- Train a **CNN model** to classify signs.  
- Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix.  
- **Bonus:** Add data augmentation and compare custom CNN vs pre-trained models (MobileNet, ResNet).
