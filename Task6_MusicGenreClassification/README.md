# Task 6: Music Genre Classification

## Introduction
Classify songs into genres based on audio features like MFCCs or spectrograms.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [GTZAN Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Contains audio files labeled by music genre.
- **Complete data set file was greater than 25MB (even its zipfile), so download it from the above link** 
## Task Completion Points
- Preprocess audio features (MFCCs) or convert to spectrograms.  
- Train **multi-class models** (ML models for tabular, CNNs for images).  
- Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix.  
- **Bonus:** Compare tabular vs CNN approach, and try **transfer learning** with spectrograms.
