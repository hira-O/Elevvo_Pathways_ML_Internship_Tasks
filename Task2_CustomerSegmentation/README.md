## Introduction
Cluster mall customers into meaningful segments based on income and spending behavior using unsupervised learning.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Mall Customer Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Includes attributes like customer ID, age, income, and spending score.

## Task Completion Points
- Load and preprocess the dataset.  
- Scale numerical features.  
- Use **K-Means clustering** and find the optimal number of clusters (Elbow method).  
- Visualize clusters in 2D.  
- **Bonus:** Try other algorithms like **DBSCAN** and analyze spending patterns per cluster.
