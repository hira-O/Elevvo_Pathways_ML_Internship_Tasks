# Machine Learning Tasks Collection

This repository contains my practice tasks and mini-projects in machine learning & data science.  
Each folder has a Jupyter Notebook and dataset, along with a small README explaining the task.  

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
The project uses the following main Python libraries:  
- pandas, numpy (data handling)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)  
- scikit-learn (machine learning)  
- xgboost, lightgbm (advanced models)  
- tensorflow, keras (deep learning)  
- librosa (audio processing)  
- opencv-python (image processing)  

ðŸ‘‰ For the complete list, check [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt).
