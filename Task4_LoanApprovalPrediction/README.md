## Introduction
Predict whether a loan application will be approved using historical application data. Focus on imbalanced data evaluation.

## Task Completion Points
- Load and preprocess dataset (handle missing values, encode categories).  
- Analyze class imbalance and apply **SMOTE** or class weights.  
- Train **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** classifiers.  
- Evaluate using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- **Bonus:** Try hyperparameter tuning and compare models.
